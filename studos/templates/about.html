    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are a student-focused assistance platform built to help learners handle the real challenges of academic life — documentation, applications, skills, and career decisions — without stress or confusion.</p>
    <p>At Stu-Dos, we don’t see students as customers. <strong>We see them as dreamers, learners, and future professionals who just need the right guidance at the right time.</strong></p>

    <h2>Why Stu-Dos Exists</h2>
    <p>In today’s world, students are expected to manage everything on their own. But reality is different. Many students feel confused, fear making mistakes, lack guidance, and don’t know whom to trust.</p>
    <p><strong>Stu-Dos was born to fill this gap.</strong> We exist to simplify processes, reduce pressure, and stand beside students when they need help the most.</p>

        <h2>A Message from the Founder</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "Stu-Dos was not born out of comfort. It was born out of struggle — struggles I have personally faced and struggles I have witnessed in countless students... Stu-Dos is a reflection of real student experiences, created to ensure that no student feels lost while trying to move forward."
        </blockquote>
